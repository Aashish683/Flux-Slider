------------------
Added the 'turn' 3D transition.

Can now specify a size for the slider canvas on init, images crop for the top-left edge

1.3.1 (2011/06/10)
------------------
The .css3() function now adds the non vendor prefixed version as well. This fixed a bug where 'concentric' & 'warp' where not round in Firefox 4.

1.3 (2011/06/09)
------------------
Made it easier to handle 3d transitions by moving the overflow logic into flux.transition.js

Fixed a bug where 3d transitions could leave the viewport in an overflow: visible state.

Ensured event object is sent to callback for .transitionEnd() helper function

Updated zepto.js to v0.6

Added a short 5ms delay before transition execution as Zepto sometimes failed to catch the transitionEnd() with some 3D transitions

Added 'tiles3d' & 'blinds3d' transitions. Thanks to Altryne (twitter.com/altryne) for porting his 'tiles3d' code to Flux!

Improved performance by using Document Fragments to reduce DOM reflows.

Added support for Modernizr feature detection with a fallback to custom detection code.

3D transformations are removed from the list of loaded transitions when the browser does not support 3D.

Added a jQuery widget for better integration with jQuery.

1.2.1 (2011/05/17)
------------------
Fixed a z-index issue with 'bars3d' under Chrome. This also reduced flicker during rendering on iOS.

1.2 (2011/05/16)
------------------
Added feature detection so any browser that supports CSS3 transitions will now work, jQuery may need to be used instead of Zepto for non Webkit based browsers.

Added helper function for detecting the Transition end .transition()

Added helper function for adding required vendor prefixes to CSS3 .css3()

Modified the base transition object so that it now maintains a reference to the slider object to make it easier to access both current and next images. Previously only the current image was stored which limited what transitions could be created.

Added support for gracefully degrading when a transition requires 3d but the browser doesn't support it

Added 'bars3d' & 'cube' 3D transitions

Fixed a bug where Chrome would report 3d transformation support when it didn't. Now uses a media query to confirm support under webkit. Similar to how Modernizr works

Enabled transition specific parameters to be overloaded from the main constructor

Improved the 'concentric' transition so that enough circles are always created to cover the required space

A specific transition can now be requested instead of one being picked at random, applies to .next(), .prev(), .showImage() and .transition() of flux.slider object

Added isPlayer() function to determine if the slider is currently auto-progressing

Added the event 'fluxTransitionEnd' which now fires whenever a transition has completed

Fixed a chaining bug with .transitionEnd() helper function

1.1
------------------
Added support for Zepto.js as a drop in replacement for jQuery

Added detection of 3d CSS effects to ensure hardware acceleration is used where possible

1.0
------------------
